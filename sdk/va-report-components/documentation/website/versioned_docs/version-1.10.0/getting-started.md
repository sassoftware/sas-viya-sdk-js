The SAS Visual Analytics SDK enables you to use the power of SAS Visual Analytics in your own websites and HTML applications.
You can embed entire reports with the `<sas-report>` custom HTML element, embed a single object with the
`<sas-report-object>` element, or connect to your reports with our JavaScript API.

## Installation

### NPM

The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sassoftware/va-report-components">`@sassoftware/va-report-components`</a> library is published to NPM and can be installed by running the `npm install` command as shown below. `va-report-components` does not support ES6 imports. Therefore, the contents of the `va-report-components/dist` folder must be deployed with your page, and then loaded using a `script` tag.

```bash
# From the root directory of your project
npm install @sassoftware/va-report-components

# Copy the contents of the package to an asset folder for deployment
cp -r ./node_modules/@sassoftware/va-report-components ./sdk-assets
```

The library can then be loaded out of the deployed assets folder using a `script` tag.

```html
<script async src="./sdk-assets/dist/umd/va-report-components.js"></script>
```

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Accessing the `va-report-components` library from the SAS Developer CDN is easy. It does not require installation or
hosting of the library code and assets. Here is an example of loading the latest version of `va-report-components` from the CDN using an HTML `script` tag.

```html
<script async src="https://cdn.developer.sas.com/packages/va-report-components/latest/dist/umd/va-report-components.js"></script>
```

When the library is used in production, consider pinning it to an explicit version. This is done with a URL like `https://cdn.developer.sas.com/packages/va-report-components/${VERSION}/dist/umd/va-report-components.js`, where `${VERSION}` is the full `major.minor.patch` semantic version.

## SAS Viya setup

The SAS Visual Analytics SDK requires either connecting directly to SAS Viya or exporting a SAS Report Package.  Server setup requirements for connecting to SAS Viya are covered in the [SAS Viya Setup Guide](guides/viya-setup.md).

## Create a custom HTML tag

To build the custom HTML tag that you will embed in your web page:

1. Open a report in SAS Visual Analytics.
1. Open the menu in the report toolbar (which is displayed in the image below) or right-click an individual object, and then select Copy Link. The Copy Link window is displayed.
1. If you are using guest access, expand the Options heading and select the Guest access check box.
1. Click Copy Link.

Once the report link or object link has been copied to your clipboard, paste it below, and the output will show a custom HTML
tag that is ready to use.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/sdk/va/css/copy-link-translator.css">
<form>
  <textarea id="vdk-slt-input"
    rows="5"
    style="resize: none; width: 100%;"
    placeholder="Paste the link from SAS Visual Analytics here."
    aria-label="Paste the link from SAS Visual Analytics here."
  ></textarea>
  <pre><code id="vdk-slt-output" class="hljs" data-hide="true"></code></pre>
</form>
<script type="module" src="/sdk/va/js/copy-link-translator.js"></script>

For a complete list of options, see the documentation for [`SASReportElement`](api/SASReportElement.md) and
[`SASReportObjectElement`](api/SASReportObjectElement.md)
